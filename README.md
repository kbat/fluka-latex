# Installation
1. Get the code and compile main.pdf
```
git clone https://github.com/kbat/fluka-latex.git
cd fluka-latex
make
```
2. If you choose a local installation, I recommend avoiding copying the files into the folder with your lecture slides. Instead, create soft links from the `fluka-latex` folder. This approach allows for separate repositories for this style and the lecture slides.
