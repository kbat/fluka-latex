# Installation
1. Get the code and compile main.pdf
```
git clone https://github.com/kbat/fluka-latex.git
cd fluka-latex
make
```
2. Follow the instructions on slide 4 in main.pdf. If you choose a local installation, I recommend avoiding copying the files into the folder with your lecture slides. Instead, create soft links from another folder. This approach allows for separate repositories for the style and the lecture slides.
